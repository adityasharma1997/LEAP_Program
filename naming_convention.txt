Java follows a camel-case naming convention for class,object,interfaces etc.
    -- camel case is if name contains more than one word then other word always start with Upper case letter for the 
    sake of better understanding.

Naming conventions are there for making a code easily-readable for programmers. These suggested by java communities such as 
sun Microsystem and Netcape.

Class 
    -- Name always start with Upper case letter like Employee.

    public class Employee
    {
    //Code here
    }

interface
    -- Same as of class start with upper class letter like Printable

    interface Printable
    {
    //code here
    }

Method
    -- should start with lower case word and follow camel-case naming convention.
    like main, print, dosomething etc.

    class Employee{

         // method declaration

         void dosomething(){
            // code something
         }

    }

Variable 
    -- never use single letter instead use something that defines it's use 
    -- should start with lower case letter like name, id etc. and later follows a camel case.
    -- should not start with special case character like &, _ , $ , number( as 3f would be name or 
    literal with floating point with value 3 so makes confusion)

Package 
    -- should be a lower case letter and connected with dot(.) like java.lang etc.

Constants 
    -- should be all upper case letter 
    -- if multiple letter then join by uderscore like MAX_SCORE etc.
    -- It may contains digits but not as first letter.
